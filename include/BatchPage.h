/**
\brief The BatchPage class renders entities as StaticGeometry.

This is one of the geometry page types included in the StaticGeometry engine. These
page types should be added to a PagedGeometry object with PagedGeometry::addDetailLevel()
so the PagedGeometry will know how you want your geometry displayed.

To use this page type, use (the last parameter is optional):
\code
PagedGeometry::addDetailLevel<BatchPage>(farRange, transitionLength, Ogre::Any(LODLevel));
\endcode

This page type uses batched geometry (Ogre::StaticGeometry) to represent the entities.
Batched geometry is generally much faster than plain entities, since video card state
changes and transform calculations can be minimized. Batched geometry can be anywhere
from 2 to 20 times faster than plain entities.

"LODLevel" can be used to specify a certain LOD level to use from the added entities.
This would be useful, for example, if you wanted to add high-res batched trees near the camera,
and low-res batched trees farther away.
