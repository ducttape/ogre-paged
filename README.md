What is this?
=============

This is an import fork of http://code.google.com/p/ogre-paged/

I have fixed quite a lot of stuff, improved code readability and made it
conform to C++ standards. It now compiles with fairly pedantic compiler flags.
I also fixed Linux installation stuff and removed some unnecessary files.

This fork is tracking upstream.
